# My favourite movie star

This is a new test with some characters which looks like a description.
May be this works well but I can't find any useful text blocks anymore.

Should I switch to a Lorem Ipsum text or not?

## Character

* tall
* man
* young
* 20 years old
* loves chocolate
* eates fruits
* drives a black car
* strong
* stupid
